# Azure inventory queries

This repository is a catalog of Azure Resource Graph queries aimed at quickly identifying resources based on the application or system workloads they support. Using a variety of filtering mechanisms, these queries identify workloads through common conventions like naming, tagging, and grouping, helping confirm that resources are deployed and distributed as intended.
