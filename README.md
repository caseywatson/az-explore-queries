This repository contains a collection of flexible and simple Azure Resource Graph queries designed to help you rapidly "size up" an Azure VM-based environment based on VM workload. Each query includes a section that allows you define how VMs should be grouped. Simply read the commented section, choose the option that best fits your scenario, and uncomment (and possibly configure) the relevant section.
